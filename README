README

Introduction:
SHuttle has been tested on Chromixium Linux 1.0 and Ubuntu Linux 14.04, both running Bash 4.3.11(1). SHuttle contains numerous Bash-isms making it unsuitable for other shells. SHuttle has few dependencies, most of which are included by default in many distros. Curl is likely the only program you will have to install.

Installation:
git clone https://github.com/andyforceno/shuttle/
cd to shuttle/
chmod +x shuttle
./shuttle

On first run, SHuttle will walk you through the setup. This requires a web browser for OAuth.
You can run setup at any time by executing ./shuttle setup

Usage:
Execute "shuttle usage" to see the full usage text. 
To summarize, commands take the following form: shuttle <action> <type> <recipient> <data> where:

<actions> 		<types>						
* push 			file, link, note, sms, weather			
* list			channels, chats, devices, pushes, user		
* chats			add, delete, update
* devices		delete, update
* help			Shorter usage text
* usage			List full usage text 		
* setup 		Oauth and setup
* Except for "usage" and "setup", all <actions> require additional parameters. 

To push notes or files:   <action> <type> <recipient> <title> <body> (<file name>)
To push links: 	          <action> <type> <recipient> <title> <URL>
       Note: If no URL title is given, SHuttle will parse the website for a title
To push clips: 		  <action> <type> <device> <clip> 
To send SMS: 		  <action> <type> <phone number> <SMS>


Notes:
SHuttle will match partial recipient names (devices or chats)
To push a note to your friend "Jane Doe":
shuttle -p -n jane "Hi Jane!" "How are you today?"


Examples (not exhaustive):
Push a weather forecast to your mobile phone:
shuttle -p -w "Galaxy S4"

Push a note to the Chrome web browser:
shuttle -p -n Chrome "This is a note title" "This is a note body"

Push a URL to your friend:
shuttle -p -l myfriend@gmail.com "https://www.github.com"
Note: SHuttle will parse the website for a title and push it along with the URL

Push an SMS:
shuttle -p -s "+1 9995551234" "Remember to buy milk"
Note: Your phone must be on the same network as your Linux machine

Rename a device:
shuttle -d -u "Phone" "mi5"

Add a chat (contact):
shuttle -c -a afriend@gmail.com 

Update a chat (contact) address:
shuttle -c -u afriend@gmail.com myfriend@gmail.com

List chats (contacts):
shuttle -l -c

List pushes (from last 7 days):
shuttle -l -p 7d
Accepts hours or days (default is 24h)









For "list" <action>:
channels		List channel subscriptions
chats | -c		List available chats recipients
devices | dev | -d	List available devices 	 
pushes			List pushes from the last t intervals (h hours, d days - default is 24h)

-----
To push notes or files:   <action> <type> <recipient> <title> <body> (<file name>)
To push links: 	          <action> <type> <recipient> <title> <URL>
       Note: If no URL title is given, SHuttle will parse the website for a title

Tips & Example usage:
--------------
To push a note to <device>:
shuttle push note "Galaxy S4" "This is the note title" "This is the note body"

Use shortcut flags for repetitive tasks or automated pushes:
shuttle -p -f "Nexus 7" "System Logs" "For 05-07-16" "/var/log/syslog.1"

Push an SMS to <phone number>:
shuttle push sms "+1 9995551234" "Remember to get milk"
(Your phone must be connected to the internet and set as "sms_device" in .shuttlerc)

Add, delete, or update <chat> email or <device> name:
shuttle chats add "Moogie the Cat" moogie@cats.com
Delete accepts partial matches of e-mail, if they are unique:
shuttle chats del "moogie@"
Update <recipient> email address or <device> name:
shuttle chats update "Moogie@cats.com" "Moogiethecat@cats.com"
shuttle chats update "Galaxy S4" "Jane's Galaxy S4"

Push weather forecast for the next few days to <device>:
shuttle -p -w "Galaxy Tab 4"
(Your zipcode must be configured in ~/.shuttlerc)

View recent pushes from the last t intervals (h hours, d days):
shuttle list pushes 3d

<device> can take underscores in place of spaces
<device> and <recipient> are case insensitive & can be a unique partial match, too:
shuttle push link galaxy_t https://github.com/andyforceno/shuttle
